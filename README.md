# backpropagation-from-scratch
 A python notebook that implements backpropagation from scratch and achieves 85% accuracy on MNIST with no regularization or data preprocessing.
 Includes a PDF with the theoretical foundations [here](/backpropagation-from-scratch.pdf).
 
## Why I made this

I decided it was important to build an intuitive understanding of backpropagation, and to be able to derive everything on paper in case I was suddenly transported back to victorian London.
